# 100 Days of code collections. 

This is a collection of the 100DaysOfCode challenge that I worked on. 

In most of the repositories you'll want to use main.py and supporting .py files to run the code. 
I'll try to add each challenge as I go along starting with Day 21 through to the end. The days before this are sporatically listed as I completed them. 
If time permits, I'll backfill these as well.
